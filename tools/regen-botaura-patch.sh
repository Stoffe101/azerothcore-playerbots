# regen-botaura-patch.sh — re-cut patches/0012-core-bot-aura-batching.patch from the fork
# working tree at azerothcore-wotlk.
#
# CORE-ONLY patch (like 0008/0009/0010, unlike every module patch): it touches
# src/server/game/Entities/Unit/Unit.{h,cpp} in the fork itself. A plain `git -C "$AC" diff`
# with NO prefix rewriting is therefore correct — the a/src/... paths already resolve from the
# fork root, which is where setup.sh's apply_patches invokes `git -C "$AC_DIR" apply`. Do NOT
# copy the --src-prefix/--dst-prefix flags from the module regen scripts; they would corrupt
# the paths. The gate below enforces this.
#
# BASELINE-AWARE (it was not, and that claim went stale): Unit.cpp is now touched by FOUR other
# patches, all of which land AFTER 0012 in the pipeline, so a naive whole-file `git diff` of the
# full-stack worktree would silently embed their hunks into 0012 (the trap that bit the 0004
# regen). The later patches on this file are:
#   * patches/0018-core-modifyaurastate-iterator-safety.patch (overlay, applied after 0012)
#   * mod-era-talents' core patches 01-shatter-crit-vs-frozen / 05-wand-spec-era-no-spell-leak /
#     06-molten-fury-era-window (applied after ALL overlay patches, by that module's own
#     apply-patches.sh)
# Because 0012 is the EARLIEST patch on these files, the right tool is a REVERSE-APPLY of the
# later patches (not an index baseline like regen-arena-patch.sh uses for a middle patch): strip
# them out of the worktree, diff, then restore the saved files. Unit.h is 0012's alone — no
# other patch touches it — but it is saved/restored with Unit.cpp so the pair stays consistent.
# The era module is a CLONE and may be absent; a missing patch file is skipped, not fatal.
# Leaves the fork worktree exactly as found.
#
# WHAT 0012 IS: at 3200 bots a host perf profile showed ~20% of all worldserver CPU in the
# per-tick aura sweeps (Aura::UpdateOwner + AuraEffect::Update + Unit::_UpdateSpells + the
# rb-tree iteration of the aura multimaps) — thousands of fully-buffed bots walking every owned
# aura every map tick to find timers that aren't due. All aura timing is diff-driven, so 0012
# accumulates the diff for BOT sessions (WorldSession::IsBot()) and runs the sweeps at ~100ms
# cadence with the summed diff: identical timing semantics, up to ~90ms added latency on
# periodic ticks/expiry, real players untouched. The current-spell pointer bookkeeping at the
# top of _UpdateSpells stays per-tick — it is order-sensitive with the event system (see the
# WARNING in Unit::Update).
#
# LITERAL PATHS ONLY on every git line — the shell does not word-split an unquoted $var, so a
# `for f in $FILES` loop would cut an empty patch (this trap has bitten the WG/publish recipes).

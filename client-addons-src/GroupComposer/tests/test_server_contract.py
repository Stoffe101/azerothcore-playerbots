"""Static client/server contract tests for Group Composer.

The 3.3.5a addon deliberately owns presentation metadata while the C++ backend owns
validation and runtime actions. These assertions make duplicated activity identifiers fail
CI loudly instead of drifting into a UI option the server rejects (or vice versa).
